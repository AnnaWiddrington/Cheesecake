## Site Structure
Love, Elle-Leigh Cheesecakes is a three page website providing information on the business and the service they provide, the default loading page is the [Home Page](index.html). Other pages on the site include the [Menu Page](menu.html) and the [Contact Page](contact.html). The Navbar on the top right allows the user to navigate between all three pages, pressing on the logo at the top of the page will also return the user to the home page.
The pages footer also contains external links to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

## Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) was used for Love, Elle-Leigh Cheesecakes. The main font used throughout the site is Exo, this is due to it being clear and easy to read. The Dancing Script font was also used for the "Elle-Leigh cheesecakes x" part of the title, this was to help sections of the title stand out to the user, this type of font is also more associated with elegance. Various part so the site use different font-weights these are between 100-700.
The backup font for all sections in the event they are unable to load and fail is sans serif. This font was chosen due to it easy accessibility.

## Imagery
The image used for the websites logo was sourced from [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com). The video was sourced from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com) as were the majority of images used for the menu and home page. Three of the images used on the menu page were taken by myself.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) was also used for all icons used throughout the website.

## Colour Scheme
In order to make the website attractive I wanted to keep the colours used varying shades of the same colour, this allowed there to be consistency throughout the website. To find font colours which worked with the background colours I had. I used [WebAim](https://webaim.org/) in order to test the level of colour contrast. 
A colour palette was also produced using [Coolors](https://coolors.co) this allowed me to see how well the background colours and font colours worked together.
